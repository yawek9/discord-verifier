# DiscordVerifier

Simple Velocity server proxy plugin that links server groups to the Discord roles. Inspired by https://github.com/StaticFX/DiscordBotBungee.

# Guide

Default permission for the /discord commands is 'discordverifier.discord'. Additional permission for using admin commands is 'discordverifier.admin'.

Color codes in config.yml are set by using custom hex based prefixes.

Single color: &(hex color)(text)

Two-color gradient: &#gr(hex color)(hex color)(text)

Rainbow: &#rb(text)

Support is only for the MySQL database. All permission plugins should be working, but it was tested with LuckPerms only.
